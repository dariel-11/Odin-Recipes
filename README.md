# Odin-Recipes
Recipe Website

This is the first project of The Odin Project's Foundations course. Here you will

I must demonstrate all the skill learned so far when writing out the html code.
For example, webpage title, headers, any lists (both ordered and unordered), 
anchor tags along with absolute or relative links within the webpage.
